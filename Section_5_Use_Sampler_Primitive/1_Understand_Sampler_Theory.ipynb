Running this many times (shots) gives you a histogram of counts. The Sampler formalizes this process but adds a layer of abstraction that allows for:\n",

                "\n",
                "**The Theory**: Twirling wraps a noisy gate (like a CNOT) with random Pauli gates ($I, X, Y, Z$) that mathematically cancel out effectively to the identity operation *if there were no noise*. However, in the presence of noise, this randomization converts \"coherent\" errors (systematic shifts) into \"incoherent\" stochastic noise (random bit flips).\n",

                "*   **Why do this?** Incoherent noise leads to the \"depolarizing channel,\" which is much easier to model and mitigate than coherent errors. It turns a \"bad\" predictable error into \"random\" noise that averages out."
